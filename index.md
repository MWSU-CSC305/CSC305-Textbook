# Database Architecture and Concepts

This book is a **practical guide to working with relational databases**.

The documents here are not reference notes or supplementary material.  
They are the primary source of instruction.

### What This Book Focuses On

This book focuses on **using relational databases correctly**.

You will see repeated emphasis on:

- structure and rules
- predictable behavior
- safety when modifying data
- clarity over cleverness
- habits that prevent mistakes

SQL is used as the primary tool for explanation whenever possible.

### What This Book Does Not Try to Be

This book is not:

- a database theory textbook
- a catalog of every SQL feature
- a guide to advanced optimization
- a deep dive into database internals
- a survey of all database technologies

Those topics matter in other contexts.  
They are intentionally out of scope here.

### The Documents

The documents in this book follow a deliberate progression:

- what a database is and why it exists  
- how data is structured internally  
- how to read data safely  
- how to modify data deliberately  
- why data is split across tables  
- how tables are connected with keys  
- how multiple tables are used together  
- how to design small, reasonable schemas  
- how databases fit into real systems  

Each document exists to answer a specific question and set up the next one.

### A Final Note

Databases reward care, clarity, and restraint.

If you approach these documents with the goal of understanding **why things behave the way they do**, not just how to write SQL, the material will hold together.

That is the standard this book is written to meet.
